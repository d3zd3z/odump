Installation
------------

To install Uuidm you need at least : 

    OCaml >= 3.10.0  

If you have `findlib`, it can be installed by typing :

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    ocaml setup.ml -build 
    ocaml setup.ml -install

If you don't, `uuidm.mli` and `uuidm.ml` contain everything, the
code, the documentation and the license. Install the dependencies and
use the sources the way you want. For example if you use `ocamlbuild`
you can issue the following commands from the root directory of your
project :

    ln -s /path/to/uuidm-0.9.4/src uuidm
    echo "<uuidm> : include" >> _tags


Documentation
-------------

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from `uuidm.mli`. For you convenience you can find a
generated version in the `doc` directory of the distribution.


Sample programs
---------------

Sample programs are located in the `test` directory of the
distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild test/tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test` :

- `test.native` tests the library, nothing should fail.
- `perf.native` tests the performance of the library, see `perf.native -help`.
- `uuidtrip.native` outputs UUIDs, see `uuidtrip.native -help`.
