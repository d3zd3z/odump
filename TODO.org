* Notes of things to do.

** C bindings
   Things that are either missing, or inadequate from the Unix or
   other bindings in ocaml.

   - [X] readdir - need to return name/inode pairs
   - [X] lstat - return finer grained time and more int64s
   - [X] open  - be able to pass in NOATIME flag to open
   - [X] utimensat - Set time, accurately, and not following
   - [X] mknod
   - [X] lchown  - exist
   - [ ] read/write that don't copy (later?)  will block the GC

** Tasks to get minimal functionality

   - [X] Generic walker code
   - [X] restore
   - [X] seen-db conversions
   - [X] backup
   - [X] Use seen-db in backup

** Tasks to be comparable to jpool

   - [X] general logger
   - [X] progress meter (can be improved)
   - [X] clone command
   - [X] index recovery
   - [ ] 64-bit uid/gid (not sure this is ever necessary)
   - [X] pool locking
   - [ ] pool hash verification
   - [ ] don't cross device boundaries
   - [X] progress meter on backup
   - [ ] manual prune of expired cache entries
   - [ ] flush pool and index files on write

** Tasks to extend functionality

   - [X] Simple size scanning
   - [ ] Tree comparisons
   - [ ] Write statistics on clone
   - [ ] Store canonical path in backup to make cache regeneration easier
   - [ ] Exclusion lists
   - [ ] read-only open of pool, with read locking
   - [X] config file, to set default pool

** Misc things (cleanups etc)

   - [ ] Build source as library and two executables that use it.
   - [X] Properly close/cleanup pools
   - [ ] Allow #enter on traveral to abort the traversal (maybe there
     isn't anything to do here, since raising an exception might just
     work).
   - [ ] Better control over when hashes are verified.  Normally, we
     probably only want to verify them when explicitly asked to, or
     perhaps when restoring.
   - [ ] Progress meter on multiple-clones doesn't cleanup properly.
   - [ ] Disable progress meter on unit tests
   - [ ] Nicer timestamps in log messages
   - [X] Proper command line processing
   - [ ] Custom progress meter for clone as well  The whole meter
     needs to be cleaned up a bit, perhaps made into a functor/module
     instead of done with classes.
   - [ ] Improve UI for cache creation.  Allow the user to specify the
     destination name of the new cache, which will be useful for
     remote backups.  Provide a utility to ask for the cache path of a
     given name.

   - [ ] Store the backups last done into the seen cache.  Detect if
     one is missing (or out of date), and refresh it by walking the
     current backup.  This approach will work well for network
     backups.  Need to solve the notion of canonical names for backups
     so we can definitively refer to older backups.

   - [X] Distinguish short help text from long help.
   - [X] Don't use the Batteries handler, but use the exposed argument
     spec type.

   - [ ] Compute a version string and encoding it into the
     executable.  I'm thinking of finding the most recent tag, and
     then using a timestamp of the HEAD commit if the tree is dirty
     (rather than just a hash).

** Big things

*** Network backup

** Problem with jpool

   Things that jpool is also broken with that probably should be
   fixed.

   - [ ] Restore of non-regular nodes that are hardlinked.

*** Traversal structures

    The 'du' command as well as various garbage collection algorithms
    need to keep track of which nodes have been visited.  Storing
    hashes redundantly takes a lot of memory.

    Since we already have all of the hashes stored, anyway, and
    existing files never grow, we can enumerate all of the hashes
    (based on the offset with in each file).  This would have to be
    added to the pool code as mapping that would be specific to the
    local pool.

    - [X] Hash indices for traversal

    Need to analyze which data structure is best for storing this
    result.  The tree-based ones seem good for traversals that
    represent a small subset of the data.

    Sizes

    | Structure  |     Size | in MB  |
    |------------+----------+--------|
    | Set.IntSet | 22257040 | 21.2MB |
    | ISet       | 10940288 | 10.4MB |
    | BitSet     |   260008 | 0.2MB  |

    So, clearly, for larger data sets, just using a bitset wins.

    For du and comparison between trees, we probably want a cache of
    each directory and information about it's size.  This might be
    best stored in a local database.

* Things beyond the backup itself

  - [ ] Manage BTR snapshots
  - [ ] Scheduling and other stuff that I have in scripts now

* Size statistics from my backups:
