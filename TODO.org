* Notes of things to do.

** C bindings
   Things that are either missing, or inadequate from the Unix or
   other bindings in ocaml.

   - [X] readdir - need to return name/inode pairs
   - [X] lstat - return finer grained time and more int64s
   - [X] open  - be able to pass in NOATIME flag to open
   - [ ] utimensat - Set time, accurately, and not following
   - [ ] mknod
   - [ ] lchown  - exist
   - [ ] read/write that don't copy (later?)  will block the GC

** Tasks to get minimal functionality

   - [ ] restore
   - [ ] seen-db conversions
   - [ ] backup

** Tasks to be comparable to jpool

   - [ ] general logger
   - [ ] progress meter (can be improved)
   - [ ] clone command

** Tasks to extend functionality

   - [ ] Size scanning
   - [ ] Tree comparisons

** Misc things (cleanups etc)

   - [ ] Build source as library and two executables that use it.
